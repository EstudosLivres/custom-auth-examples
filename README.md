# Ionic Platform Custom Auth Examples

These examples will get you up and running using Ionic Auth with your own
server backend.

Examples are organized by web framework. Each example runs on port 5000 and
defines a route, `/auth`, which is the entry point.

For these examples, we will be using the shared secret `foxtrot` and the
endpoint `http://localhost:5000/auth`. These custom auth config options are
specified in **User Auth** settings in [apps.ionic.io](https://apps.ionic.io)
under **Custom**.

Documentation for custom authentication can be found
[here](http://docs.ionic.io/docs/custom-authentication).
